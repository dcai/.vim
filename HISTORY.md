## Phase 2: Intermediate Growth (2016–2019) – Plugin Exploration and Workflow Refinement

- **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion**: By 2016–2017, you transitioned from Vundle to **vim-plug** (`e6f1282`), a more modern plugin manager, reflecting a growing comfort with Vim’s ecosystem. This period saw heavy experimentation with plugins:
  - **Syntax and Linting**: Added **Syntastic** (`74c9798`) and later **ALE** (`a5cc333`) for linting and fixing, showing a focus on code quality.
  - **Navigation and Editing**: Introduced **fzf** (`980ad47`), **NERDCommenter** (`e370ec1`), and **vim-easy-align** (`a532e27`) for faster navigation and text manipulation.
  - **Colorschemes**: Developed a custom scheme, **desert2.vim** (`379fe71`), forked from `desert.vim` (`5e35e67`), indicating a desire for a tailored aesthetic.
  - **Language Support**: Added support for languages like JavaScript (`c5031c9`), PHP (`e461c6e`), and Python (`da8baae`) with plugins like **vim-javascript** and **yapf**.
- **Key Mapping Evolution**: You refined key bindings extensively:
  - Adopted `<space>` as the leader key (`79756fe`), aligning with modern Vim conventions.
  - Added ergonomic mappings like `jj`/`jk` to escape (`267cc35`), a common optimization for efficiency.
- **Workflow Improvements**:
  - Introduced **lightline** (`12f1ae7`) for a lightweight statusline, replacing heavier alternatives.
  - Focused on Git integration with **vim-fugitive** (`96ca911`) and key bindings for Git operations (`e95eb5a`).
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Shift from basic functionality to a developer-centric setup with linting, autocompletion, and version control.
  - Growing customization of the UI (colors, statusline) and key bindings, reflecting increased Vim fluency.

## Phase 3: Advanced Customization (2020–2022) – Neovim Adoption and Lua Transition

- **Neovim Adoption**: Around 2020–2021 (3–4 years ago), you began integrating Neovim-specific features:
  - Linked `init.vim` to `vimrc` (`edaef23`), signaling a gradual shift to Neovim.
  - Added Neovim-specific plugins like **treesitter** (`4c6d5e8`) for better syntax highlighting and **mini.nvim** (`eb7c79f`) for modular utilities.
- **Lua Introduction**: By 2021, Lua-based configuration emerged:
  - Moved plugin configs to Lua files (e.g., `a8030ac`), leveraging Neovim’s Lua runtime for faster and more modular scripting.
  - Adopted **lspconfig** (`5756f22`) for Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, enhancing code intelligence for languages like PHP, TypeScript, and Python.
- **Plugin Refinement**:
  - Replaced older tools (e.g., **Syntastic** with **ALE**, `8a997b5`) and added modern ones like **gp.nvim** (`7274f42`) for AI-assisted coding and **which-key** (`b724c1b`) for keybinding hints.
  - Focused on Git workflows with **gitsigns** (`ac878c3`) and **fugitive** enhancements.
- **UI and Aesthetics**: Continued refining your custom **oasis** colorscheme (`9bcac16`), adding support for LSP diagnostics and better highlighting (`e15410f`).
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Full embrace of Neovim’s capabilities (LSP, Lua, Treesitter), marking a shift to a power user.
  - Streamlined plugin set, focusing on performance and modern tools over legacy ones.
